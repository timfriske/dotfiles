# Configuration of Tmux
# =====================
# Tim Friske <me@tifr.de>
#
# _Tmux_ is a terminal multiplexer software that lets users make better
# use of the screen of a virtual terminal.  It allows them to organize
# their work into several sessions, windows and panes.
#
# Users can switch sessions by connecting their _Tmux_ client from one
# and detach it to another.  Within one session they can then navigate
# between multiple windows each of which may be split into a number of
# panes.  A pane is finally the place where a user usually uses an
# interactive shell to run further programs.
#
# This configuration file shall provide _Tmux_ with sensible settings
# and personalized key bindings in order to make it more accessible.  It
# is split into a section with options only and one with key bindings
# only.
#
# The section of options constitutes the first part of this file.  It
# only configures those server-, global session and -window options with
# impractical settings.  Options with reasonable defaults are not listed
# here but implicitly assumed following the principle of _Convention
# over Configuration_.
#
# The very user specific section of key bindings follows the more
# generic section of options because key bindings are usually a matter
# of strong personal preference with only few chances for acceptance by
# a broader user base.
#

#   https://tmux.github.io[Tmux website]
#   https://linux.die.net/man/1/tmux[Tmux manpage]

# Options
# -------

# Escape time
# ~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Pass escape sequences directly through to the programs running in
# panes in order to prevent any noticable delays.  Setting `escape-time`
# to `0` makes the `Esc` key in the Vim-editor work again without
# delays.
#
# Stop _Tmux_ from waiting `escape-time` milliseconds until it may
# reliably determine if an escape sequence is part of a bound function
# or meta key.
#
# Default::
#   set-option -s escape-time 500
#
set-option -s escape-time 0

# Default terminal
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Assume that the modern terminal _Tmux_ supports 256 colors instead of
# _Tmux_ falling back to `screen' without 256 color support as the
# default terminal.
#
# Default::
#   set-option -s default-terminal 'screen'
#
set-option -s default-terminal 'tmux-256color'

# Default command
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Start a `non-login' shell as opposed to a `login' shell every time a
# new pane without a specific command gets created in order to prevent
# the shell from repeatedly executing code only meant to run once upon
# user login.
#
# With `default-command` set to the environment variable `${SHELL}`
# whose value usually expands to `/bin/bash` an instance of the Bash
# shell in interactive `non-login' mode is started which by default only
# reads from start-up files such as `~/.bashrc` but not `~/.bash_login`
# and the like.
#
# Default::
#   set-option -g default-command ''
#
set-option -g default-command '${SHELL}'

# Prefix
# ~~~~~~
#
# Use `Ctrl-s` as the prefix to prefixed key bindings because `Ctrl-s`
# is easily reachable by one hand as opposed to the default `Ctrl-b`
# where you had to stretch your fingers too much.  With `Ctrl-s` while
# simultaneously pressing the right `Ctrl` and `s` keys with the left
# hand the right hand is free to reach out even to the farthest prefixed
# key.
#
# Default::
#   set-option -g prefix C-b
#
set-option -g prefix C-s

# Mode keys, status keys
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Make unconditional use of the specified editor's default key bindings
# in copy mode and command line mode in order to not depend upon whether
# the values of the environment variables `VISUAL` or `EDITOR` contain
# the string `vi` implicitly switching from Emacs- to Vi-editor-like key
# bindings.
#
# Prefer `vi` key bindings in copy mode because the owner of this file
# is much more aquainted with the Vi-editor and its modern derivates Vim
# and NeoVim.  Choose `emacs` key bindings in command line mode because
# these are also the default in Vi's command line mode.
#
# Default::
#   set-option -g mode-keys <'emacs' unless "$VISUAL" or "$EDITOR"
#   contains 'vi'>
# Default::
#   set-option -g status-keys <'emacs' unless "$VISUAL" or "$EDITOR"
#   contains 'vi'>
#
set-option -g mode-keys vi
set-option -g status-keys emacs

# Base index, pane base index
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Align the indexes of windows and panes with the keyboard layout of the
# row of digit keys from `1` to `9` and `0`.  This alignment saves the
# user's hands and fingers from jumping back and forth between the most
# distant digit keys which are `0` and `1` to reach the otherwise zeroth
# and first window or pane.
#
# Default::
#   set-option -g base-index 0
# Default::
#   set-option -g pane-base-index 0
#
set-option -g base-index 1
set-option -g pane-base-index 1

# Renumber windows
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Renumber windows automatically in order to leave no gaps when
# destroying some of them because the user most probably won't remember
# those gaps giving him a hard time to guess the right index for a
# window after he created and destroyed several windows over an extended
# period of time.  By setting `renumber-windows` to `on` the user can
# rely on an always contiguous, strict montonically increasing sequence
# of window indexes.
#
# Default::
#   set-option -g renumber-windows off
#
set-option -g renumber-windows on

# History limit, history file
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Make far older, exactly `history-limit` number of lines from the pane
# accessible again through the scrollback buffer once those lines start
# to disappear from the top of a pane.
#
# Persist and restore `history-limit` number of lines from tmux's
# command prompt in the given `history-file` between invocations of
# _Tmux_ to have those previous commands readily available next time.
#
# NOTE: Be mindful to choose a reasonable number of `history-limit`
# lines.  One such scrollback buffer is reserved per pane but cannot be
# resized to regain that memory other than to destroy the pane losing
# all of its past and present contents.  Therefore you should multiply
# the potential number of lines you plan to choose by the average number
# of panes you usually keep open at the same time in order to get an
# idea of the actual memory consumption.
#
# Default::
#   set-option -g history-limit 2000
# Default::
#   set-option -s history-file <'' = do not store command prompt lines>
#
set-option -g history-limit 10000
set-option -s history-file '~/.tmux.hist'

# Display time, display panes time
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Keep the last status bar message readable for as long as possible
# until the next key is pressed potentially producing another message.
# Unfortunately the same behavior cannot be configured when displaying
# information about the panes of the currently visible window.
# Therefore increase the time to 5000 milliseconds (5 seconds) for the
# info about the panes to stay in order to be readable too.
#
# Default::
#   set-option -g display-time 750
# Default::
#   set-option -g display-panes-time 1000
#
set-option -g display-time 0
set-option -g display-panes-time 5000

# Visual bell
# ~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Don't let the bell sound loudly but silently notify about it in the
# status bar instead.
#
# Default::
#   set-option -g visual-bell off
#
set-option -g visual-bell on

# Visual activity, visual silence
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Notify about any activity in a window with a message shown in the
# status bar as soon as the option `monitor-activity` is set for that
# window.  Do the same when there was silence for too long and the
# option `monitor-silence` is set.
#
# Default::
#   set-option -g visual-activity off
# Default::
#   set-option -g visual-silence off
#
set-option -g visual-activity on
set-option -g visual-silence on

# Focus events
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Pass focus events from the terminal on to the applications running in
# _Tmux_ in order to notify the applications so they can react to the
# events.
#
# NOTE: Attached clients should be detached and attached again after changing
# this option.
#
# Default::
#   set-option -s focus-events off
#
set-option -s focus-events on

# Detach on destroy
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Automatically reattach the client to the most recently active of the
# remaining sessions analogously to the default behavior when destroying
# the current pane.
#
# Default::
#   set-option -g detach-on-destroy on
#
set-option -g detach-on-destroy off

# Aggressive resize
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# By default all windows in a session are constrained to the client with
# the smallest screen size connected to that session — even if both
# clients are looking at different windows.  It seems that in this
# particular case _Screen_ has the better default where a window is only
# constrained if a client with a smaller screen is actively looking at
# it.  Fix _Tmux's_ default behavior by switching on the option
# `aggressive-resize`.
#
# Default::
#   set-option -g aggressive-resize off
#
set-option -g aggressive-resize on

# Key bindings
# ------------
#
# kbd:[Ctrl+S]::
#   Leader key (kbd:[LK]) to press to initiate Tmux commands.  The keys
#   that follow determine which Tmux command to execute depending on the
#   actual key bindings.  kbd:[LK+XYZ] means holding the leader key
#   while pressing the subsequent keys. With kbd:[LK],kbd:[XYZ] the
#   leader key must be released before any further keys are pressed.  By
#   hiding the majority, especially the less often used hot keys behind
#   a leader key, helps to avoid collisions with hot key combinations
#   already reserved by other programs or assigned to other more
#   frequently used commands.

# Enter command prompt mode
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Ease keyboard access by using kbd:[LK+Space] to enter the command
# prompt.  The kbd:[Space] key not only horizontally takes the center
# position, spans a decent length but also resides on the same row as
# the kbd:[Ctrl] key.
#
# _Tmux'_ command prompt could have been bound equally well to the even
# more accessible key binding kbd:[Ctrl+Space] but that is gladly chosen
# by power users of the _Vim_ editor to bind _Vim's_ command prompt.
# Therefore the slightly more complicated key binding kbd:[LK+Space] is
# preferred for _Tmux'_ command prompt because it is assumed to be used
# less often than _Vim's_ command prompt.
#
# Normal mode::
#   kbd:[LK+Space];;
#     Prompt for a command where the status bar is usually located.
#
bind-key Space command-prompt

# Enter copy mode
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Ease keyboard access by using kbd:[Ctrl+Q] to enter copy mode.  The
# kbd:[Ctrl+Q] key is a good candidate if the kbd:[Ctrl+S] key was
# chosen as the prefix key because they are closely located to each
# other.  Both keys can be easily memorized since they already have an
# ancient albeit less known meaning as terminal control keys, namely
# kbd:[Ctrl+S] for `XOFF`, `Pause transition' and kbd:[Ctrl+Q] for
# `XON`, `Resume transmission' which seemingly freeze and thaw the
# terminal input and output respectively.  A further advantage to bind
# the kbd:[Ctrl+Q] key to enter the copy mode is that the `q` key alone
# for `quit' exits the copy mode quickly again.
#
# Normal mode::
#   kbd:[Ctrl+Q];;
#     Enter the copy mode to copy, page or search the current pane
#     content.
#
bind-key -n C-q copy-mode

# Cycle layouts
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Ease keyboard access to cycle through different layouts by simply
# pressing the prefix key followed by the adjacent kbd:[Ctrl+S] or
# kbd:[Ctrl+A] keys to select the next or previous layout respectively.
#
# The layouts `even-horizontal', `even-vertical', `main-horizontal',
# `main-vertical' and `tiled' are supported.
#
# Normal mode::
#   kbd:[LK+Ctrl+A];;
#     Cycle through to the previous layout.
#   kbd:[LK+Ctrl+S];;
#     Cycle through to the next layout.
#
bind-key C-a previous-layout
bind-key C-s next-layout

# Select/switch pane, window, client
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Ease keyboard access to toggle between the two most recent sessions,
# windows or panes.
#
# Normal mode::
#   kbd:[Alt+S];;
#     Toggle between the current and previous pane.
#   kbd:[Alt+Shift+S];;
#     Toggle between the current and previous window.
#   kbd:[Ctrl+Alt+S];;
#     Toggle between the current and previous session.
#
bind-key -n M-s select-pane -l
bind-key -n M-S select-window -l
bind-key -n C-M-s switch-client -l

# Rename window, session
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Ease keyboard access to rename a window or session by centering these
# commands around the letter key `n`.
#
# Normal mode::
#   kbd:[LK],kbd:[N];;
#     Rename the current window whose present name is shown as a
#     reminder.
#   kbd:[LK],kbd:[Shift+N];;
#     Rename the current session whose present name is shown as a
#     reminder.
#
bind-key n command-prompt -p 'rename window "#W":' \
  'rename-window "%%"'
bind-key N command-prompt -p 'rename session "#S":' \
  'rename-session "%%"'

# Find window by title, content
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Ease keyboad access to find a window either by name or title and
# content by centering these commands around the letter key `f`.
# Searching by window name only helps to substantially narrow down the
# found windows increasing the probability to directly jump to the
# chosen window.
#
# Normal mode::
#   kbd:[LK],kbd:[F];;
#     Find the window by name.
#   kbd:[LK],kbd:[Shift+F];;
#     Find the window by title and content.
#
bind-key f command-prompt -p 'find window by name:' \
  'find-window -N "%%"'
bind-key F command-prompt -p 'find window by title and content:' \
  'find-window -TC "%%"'

# Choose buffer, client, session, tree, window
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Ease keyboard access to choose a buffer, client, session, window or a
# tree of sessions and windows from a menu.  Bind the key that with the
# first letter of the corresponding class of objects for the key to be
# memorizable.
#
# Normal mode::
#   kbd:[LK],kbd:[B];;
#     Show a menu of buffers to paste into the current pane.
#   kbd:[LK],kbd:[C];;
#     Show a menu of clients to detach from the current session.
#   kbd:[LK],kbd:[S];;
#     Show a menu of sessions to switch the current client to.
#   kbd:[LK],kbd:[T];;
#     Show a menu of sessions and windows with the same choices.
#   kbd:[LK],kbd:[W];;
#     Show a menu of windows to switch the current client to.
#
bind-key b choose-buffer

# Detach current client, all others
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Ease keyboard access to detach clients from sessions.
#
# Normal mode::
#   kbd:[LK],kbd:[D];;
#     Detach the current client from the current session.
#   kbd:[LK],kbd:[Shift+D];;
#     Detach all but the current client from the current session.
#     Useful. e.g. to restore the window size to that of the current
#     client if restricted by another client running in a smaller
#     window.
#
bind-key d detach-client
bind-key D detach-client -a

# Switch client, create session
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Ease keyboard access to the most useful session commands by centering
# them around the arrow keys `h`, `j`, `k` and `l` in
# combination with the modifier keys kbd:[Ctrl] and kbd:[Alt].
#
# Normal mode::
#   kbd:[Ctrl+Alt+H];;
#     Switch the client to the previous session.
#   kbd:[Ctrl+Alt+J];;
#     Create a session and leave the client attached to the current one.
#   kbd:[Ctrl+Alt+K];;
#     Create a session and attach the client to the new one.
#   kbd:[Ctrl+Alt+L];;
#     Switch the client to the next session.

# Create, cycle, swap windows
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Ease keyboard access to the most useful window commands by centering
# them around the arrow keys kbd:[Up], kbd:[Down], kbd:[Left] and
# kbd:[Right] in combination with the modifier keys kbd:[Alt] and

#
# Create windows in current working directory instead of the home

# Enter incremental search mode
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Make the search directly accessible from normal mode.  Without these
# key bindings the user had to issue two commands.  The first command
# only to switch into copy mode and the second one to get prompted for
# the search string.
#
# Unfortunately the much better `incremental' search is only bound by
# default in copy mode `emacs` whereas only the inferior `normal' search
# is bound by default in copy mode `vi`.
#
# The key bindings below enable the user to start searching upon
# entering the very first few characters of the search string.  While
# typing the search results get continually updated, i.e. narrowed the
# more and widened the less characters are used to refine the search.
# For these reasons this so called `incremental' search is preferred
# over the default search mechansim which starts to search only when the
# user entered the entire search string.  With the standard mechansim
# the user had to enter the same keys again and again every time he
# wishes to adapt the search string.
