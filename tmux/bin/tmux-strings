# Tmux Strings
# ============
# Tim Friske <me@tifr.de>
#
# Print all strings of the current Tmux pane, e.g. for searching and
# selecting individual strings. The output can be written into a file
# or piped into programs such as _awk_, _sed_, _grep_, _fzf_ etc. for
# further processing.
#
# For the user to easier select embedded strings the lines are split
# into strings around whitespace and each string printed on a new line.
# Blank lines and lines consisting of only punctation are removed from
# the output because they are most likely of no interest to the user.
#
# Deps:: env, sed, sh, sort, tmux

  # 2. Split strings around whitespace and print one string per line.
  # 3. Delete duplicate lines.
  # 4. Delete lines only consisting of whitespace or punctation.
