# Tmux Strings
# ============

#
# Print all strings of the current Tmux pane, e.g. for searching and selecting
# individual strings. The output can be written into a file or piped into
# programs such as _awk_, _sed_, _grep_, _fzf_ etc. for further processing.
#
# For the user to easier select embedded strings the lines are split into
# strings around whitespace and each string printed on a new line. Blank lines
# and lines consisting of only punctation are removed from the output because
# they are most likely of no interest to the user.
#
# Deps:: bash, env, sed, sort, tmux

# Ensure fail-fast script execution.

# 1. Capture entire pane and print it.
# 2. Split strings around whitespace and print one string per line.
# 3. Delete duplicate lines.
# 4. Delete lines only consisting of whitespace or punctation.
