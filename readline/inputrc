# Readline configuration
# ======================
# Tim Friske <me@tifr.de>
#
# Configures the behavior of _GNU's_ _Readline_ library used for example
# by the _Bash_ shell in its interactive mode for line editing.
#
# When a program which uses the _Readline_ library starts up, _Readline_
# reads and executes commands from its config files but only if these
# exist and are readable.  It first reads its system-wide config file
# `/etc/inputrc`.  It then continues to read its user-specific config
# file `~/.inputrc`.
#
# This config file shall contain only non-default settings in order to
# keep it lean and thus easy to understand and maintain.
#
# See also:
#   * info:readline
#   * man:bash[1]
#   * $INPUTRC
#   * {system-home}/inputrc
#   * {user-home}/.inputrc

set completion-map-case on

# Echo control characters such as `CTRL-C` as `^C`.

# Assume that the user is well versed in most key bindings of the _Vi_
# text editor or one of its compatible clones such as _Vim_.

set editing-mode vi

# Yank killed text into the editing buffer as single string and not
# multiple characters hereby preventing individual characters from being

# Mark symbolically linked directories the same as ordinary directories,
# namely by appending the `/` slash sign, during file name completion.
#
set mark-symlinked-directories on

# without having the user to prefix them with the `.` dot sign.
#
set match-hidden-files off

# Display the common prefix of possible completions before cycling
# through them.
#
set menu-complete-display-prefix on

# Words which have several possible completions cause these to be
# immediately listed instead of ringing the bell.
#
set show-all-if-ambiguous on

# Words which have several possible completions without any partial
# completion cause these to be immediately listed instead of ringing the
# bell.
#
set show-all-if-unmodified on

# Indicate in which mode the editing buffer is currently in.
#
set show-mode-in-prompt on

# When the cursor is in the middle of a word while completing it treat
# its trailing characters as part of the completion and just skip them
# by moving the cursor over them.
#

# Indicate that the editing buffer is currently in _Vi's_ _Command_ mode
# with the given string.

# Indicate the file types when listing possible completions, namely by
# appending a type discriminator sign, during file name completion.
