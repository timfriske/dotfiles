# Fix Directory Permissions command
# =================================
# Tim Friske <me@tifr.de>
#
# WARNING: Potentially dangerous command because it may change metadata of
# filesystem objects inadvertently and irreversible!
#
# Utility program that finds folders which are not readable, writable and
# traversable by the owning user and group and/or not readable and traversable
# by others, and resets the deviating folders to exactly these permissions
# eventually. Whether the group has write access depends on whether it has the
# same name as the user.
#
# Note: Changing filesystem object metadata usually requires super user
# privileges which can be obtained with `sudo` and/or `su`.
#
# Deps:: bash, chmod, env, find, sh, xargs

# Ensure fail-fast script execution.
