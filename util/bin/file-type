# File Type command
# =================
# Tim Friske <me@tifr.de>
#
# Simple utility program to detect the type of a file. If the given
# file does not exist it is searched in the directories listed in the
# `PATH` environment variable and the first match is detected if any.
# In case the wrong number of arguments were given or the file could
# not be found an error message is printed and this program aborts with
# a non-zero exit status.
#
# Think about aliasing this helper program as e.g. `ft` (`file-type`)
# should you be using it frequently.
#
# Deps:: bash, env, file

# Ensure fail-fast script execution.
