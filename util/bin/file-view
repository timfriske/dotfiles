# File View command
# =================
# Tim Friske <me@tifr.de>
#
# Simple utility program to view a file. If the given file does not
# exist it is searched in the directories listed in the `PATH`
# environment variable and the first match is viewed if any. In case
# the wrong number of arguments were given or the file could not be
# found an error message is printed and this program aborts with a non-
# zero exit status.
#
# The file is viewed with a pager program. The pagers `less` and `more`
# are used unless another one is chosen via the `PAGER` environment
# variable. The pager program must recognize a double dash as the end-
# of-options marker and accept the given file as its first positional
# argument.
#
# Think about aliasing this helper program as e.g. `fv` (`file-view`)
# should you be using it frequently.
#
# Deps:: env, less, more, sh

# Ensure fail-fast script execution.
