# WARNING: Potentially dangerous command because it may change metadata
# of filesystem objects inadvertently and irreversible!
#
# Utility program that changes the user ID and group ID of the given
# file or all files below the given folder to the given user's ID and
# its primary group. Unless specified the user defaults to the current
# user and the path to the current working directory.
#
# Note: Changing filesystem object metadata usually requires super user
# privileges which can be obtained with `sudo` and/or `su`.
#
# Deps:: bash, chown, env, id, sudo

# Ensure fail-fast script execution.
