# Fix World-Writable command
# ==========================
# Tim Friske <me@tifr.de>
#
# WARNING: Potentially dangerous command because it may change metadata of
# filesystem objects inadvertently and irreversible!
#
# Utility program that finds files and folders which are world-readable, i.e.
# have the write-bit for other users set, and makes them inaccessible by
# removing that bit.
#
# Note: Changing filesystem object metadata usually requires super user
# privileges which can be obtained with `sudo` and/or `su`.
#
# Deps:: bash, chmod, env, find, xargs

# Ensure fail-fast script execution.
