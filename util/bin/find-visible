# Find Visible command
# ====================
# Tim Friske <me@tifr.de>
#
# Utility program that finds only visible files and folders below the
# given folder or current one by default.
#
# Additional arguments may be specified in which case the first one is
# treated as the search folder and the remaining ones as search
# criteria.
#
# Hidden files and folders are those starting with a dot sign. Hidden
# directories are entirely skipped to speed up the search process.
# Consider the `fd` program as a modern alternative to `find` because it
# excludes hidden entries by default.
#
# Deps:: bash, env, find
