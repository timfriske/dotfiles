# Diff Directories command
# ========================
# Tim Friske <me@tifr.de>
#
# When comparing directories only show the name of the files which are
# in either one of the two given directories or differ. Do not show the
# differences in content between the actual files because that would
# result in cognitive overload.
#
# Deps:: bash, diff, env

# Ensure fail-fast script execution.
