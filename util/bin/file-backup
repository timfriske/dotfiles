# File Backup command
# ===================
# Tim Friske <me@tifr.de>
#
# Simple backup utility to backup a single file by creating numbered
# backups of that file. Upon every invocation with the same file
# argument this utility creates another file with an increasing number
# embedded in its file name. For example given the file `foobar.txt`
# over time the files `foobar.txt~1~`, `foobar.txt~2~` etc. come into
# existence.
#
# Think about aliasing this helper program as `fb` (`file-backup`)
# should you be using it frequently.
#
# Deps:: bash, cp, env

# Ensure fail-fast script execution.
