# Argo Watch List Cmd command
# ===========================
# Tim Friske <me@tifr.de>
#
# Lists as many Argo workflows as there are terminal lines, optionally minus a
# number of header lines. This command is supposed to be invoked by the
# `argo-watch-list` command in order to watch (regularly refresh) the list of
# Argo workflows. The list may additionally be restricted to only those Argo
# workflows in certain status. Multiple status may be given as comma-separated
# list (no spaces).
#
# Deps:: argo, bash, env, tput
