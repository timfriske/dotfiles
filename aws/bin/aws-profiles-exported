# AWS Profiles command
# ====================
# Tim Friske <me@tifr.de>
#
# Lists potential environment variable declarations of the configured AWS
# profiles ready to be exported by shells, alphanumerically sorted by profile
# name. Optionally filters the profile names by one or more given extended
# regular expressions. In order for an environment variable declaration to take
# effect for the current and child processes it must be actually executed by a
# shell.
#
# Deps:: aws, bash, env, grep, sort

# Ensure fail-fast script execution.
