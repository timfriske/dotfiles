# SSH user key generation
# =======================
# Tim Friske <me@tifr.de>
#
# This interactive program generates _SSH_ keys for the current user.
# It generates two keys, one _Ed25519_ key and one _RSA-4096_ key.  Any
# options are presented to the user whose default values s/he can either
# accept or overwrite.
#
# Important note: For increased security and performance you should
# prefer the modern _Ed25519_ key whenever possible.  For compatibility
# with older _SSH_ implementations you can fallback to the dated but
# widely supported _RSA-4096_ key.
#
# Tip: Run this program with `sudo` as another user to generate _SSH_
# keys for that user on-the-fly, i.e. without logging in as that user
# and out again.

# Fail-fast and abort this program.

# Generate the following types of _SSH_ keys for below reasons:
#
#   1. Ed25519: Generates a public and private key pair encoded
#      according to the _EdDSA_ _Edwards-curve Digital Signature
#      Algorithm_ public-key cryptography algorithm because it seems to
#      be the type of key with the most secure and also fastest digital
#      signature scheme currently supported by _SSH_ implementations
#      such as _OpenSSH_.  Other advantages are that an _Ed25519_ key is
#      of fixed length and also relatively short, e.g.  when compared to
#      variable length types of keys such as _RSA_.
#
#   2. RSA: Generates a public and private key pair encoded according to
#      the _RSA_ _Rivest, Shamir and Adleman_ public-key cryptography
#      algorithm as a second best choice compared to the _Ed25519_ key
#      mainly for compatibility with older _SSH_ implementations.
#
# Make use of the following non-standard options for below reasons:
#
#   1. Output file (f): Write the public/private key pair into files
#      with the given name prefix.
#
#   2. Type (t): Generate the public/private key pair with the most
#      secure/compatible types of algorithms.
#
#   3. Key size (b): Increase the key size to make the public/private
#      key pair even more secure.
#
#   4. Comment (C): Embed the given comment into the public/private key
#      pair in order to be able to identify the key pair and to
#      differentiate it from others.
#
#   5. New-format private key (o): Save the private key in _OpenSSH's_
#      new file format that makes the private key harder for attackers
#      to disclose and corrupt.  The `-o` flag is already the default
#      for an _Ed25519_ key but should be explicitly set for any other
#      protocol version 2 key.
#
#   6. KDF rounds (a): Increase the _KDF_ _Key Derivation Function_
#      rounds in order to make it harder to brute-force crack the
#      passphrase of the private key.
