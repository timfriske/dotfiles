# Insert fuzzy-found Git branches into command line
# =================================================
# Tim Friske <me@tifr.de>
#
# Program to let the user list _Git_ branches, fuzzy-find, pick and perform
# actions on those s/he is interested in. The branches are represented by their
# short reference names (refname:short) for quick identification. Each branch is
# hereby displayed on its own line. The branches are sorted by version under the
# assumption that they might contain version identfiers.
#
# Note that this program is intended for interactive use. For quick access it
# should be bound to a hot key such as `Ctrl-gb` (mnemonic `git branch') as
# follows:
#
# .Intended usage (`~/.bashrc`)
# [source,bash]
# ----
# # Test if fuzzy finder program _Fzf_ is installed.
# if type -p fzf &> /dev/null; then
#   source fzf-insert.bash &> /dev/null
#   if source fzf-git-branch-insert.bash &> /dev/null; then
#     bind -m vi-insert -x '"\C-gb": "fzf_git_branch_insert"'
#     bind -m vi-command '"\C-gb": "i\C-gb"'
#   fi

# Deps:: bash, fzf-git-branch, fzf-insert
