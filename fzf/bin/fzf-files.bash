#
# This utility program searches below the current folder for files and
# if found, quotes any special characters in their names, sorts them by
# version and let the user fuzzy-find and pick one or more of them
# interactively.
#
# Note that this _Bash_ file is intended for interactive use.  It should
# be sourced by a parent shell and bound to a hot key such as `Ctrl-af`
# (mnemonic `all files') as follows:
#
# .Intended usage
