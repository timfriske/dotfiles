# Insert Fzf output into command line
# ===================================
# Tim Friske <me@tifr.de>
#
# The _Fzf-insert_ _Bash_ script's `fzf_insert` function when invoked evaluates
# a given command string and inserts its output into the command line editing
# buffer at the cursor's current position. This function is meant to be used
# with commands whose output is piped through _Fzf_ for the user to fuzzy-find
# and select the records s/he is interested in. Once the user made her/his
# selection the function inserts those records into the editing buffer.
#
# For _Fzf-insert_ to work it must have direct access to the user's _Bash_
# shell. Therefore this script must be sourced by _Bash_ such that its
# definitions become part of the shell. For example by adding the following code
# to _Bash's_ startup file for interactive shells:
#
# .Example: Try to find script in `$PATH` and source it
# [source,bash]
# ----
# source fzf-insert.bash &> /dev/null
# ----
#
# Deps:: bash

function space {
  if [[ -n "${1}" && ! "${1}" =~ ^[[:space:]]$ ]]; then
    printf ' '
  fi
