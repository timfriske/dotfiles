#
# Lists light-weight tags of given remote repository or `origin` by default. In
# other words remote unannotated, unsigned tags.
#
# Deps:: awk, bash, env, git-ls-remote, uniq

# Ensure fail-fast script execution.

# List remote tags. Drop commit IDs in first column. Keep tags in second column.
# Strip prefix `refs/tags/` and suffix `^{}` from tags. Keep light-weight tags,
# i.e. those that appear once because they are already references which cannot
# be dereferenced and thus are not printed a second time ending in `^{}`.
