#
# Lists light-weight tags of given remote repository or `origin` by
# default. In other words remote unannotated, unsigned tags.
#
# Deps:: awk, env, git-ls-remote, sh, uniq

# List remote tags. Drop commit IDs in first column. Keep tags in
# second column. Strip prefix `refs/tags/` and suffix `^{}` from
# tags. Keep light-weight tags, i.e. those that appear once because
# they are already references which cannot be dereferenced and thus
# are not printed a second time ending in `^{}`.
