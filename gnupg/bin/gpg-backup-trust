# GPG Backup Trust
# ================
# Tim Friske <me@tifr.de>
#
# Backs up the owner trust values in all _OpenPGP_ keys with _GPG_ by exporting
# these values into a text file ready to be imported via _GPG_ again.
#
# Any previously generated file is backed up to a file with the same name as a
# prefix but a sequential, strictly monotonically increasing integer sequence in
# the form of file extensions like `.~1~`, `.~2~` etc.
#
# The files this program produces are the following:
# 1. ${USER}.ownertrust.txt: File containing owner trust values.
# 1. ${USER}.ownertrust.txt.~1~: File of second to last run.
# 1. ${USER}.ownertrust.txt.~2~: File of last run.
#
# Important note: It is highly recommended to also export all secret keys and
# subkeys on a regular basis to create a backup history. This functionality is
# not part of this program.
#
# Important note: It is highly recommended to also export the revocation
# certificate of each secret key at least once. This functionality is not part
# of this program.
#
# Deps:: bash env gpg gpg-backup-lib

# Ensure fail-fast script execution.
