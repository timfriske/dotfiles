= Personal Software Configuration Management
Tim Friske <me@tifr.de>

Welcome to _Dotfiles_!

The project _Dotfiles_ is a personal project of mine. It serves me to manage
the configuration files of my favorite software I use on a regular basis.

When you are an IT enthusiast like me then you know how much time and effort one
is willing to spent in polishing his very own working environment to perfection.
Therefore the _Git_ repository of this project helps me to track the history of
changes so that nothing is lost.

== Project Organization & Management

=== Files & Folders

The top-level folder, i.e. the one this file resides in, MUST only contain the
most important files, i.e. only those which give an introduction to or an
overview about this project. But also files with long standing traditions and
thus well-known meanings — files people simply expect to find — MAY be located
here. Examples of these are text files such as `README`, `INSTALL`, `CHANGELOG`
or `NEWS`, `LICENSE` or `COPYING`, `CONTRIBUTING` etc. with OPTIONAL file
extensions such as `adoc`, `md`, `txt` etc.

The main content of this project — that is the configuration of each software —
MUST be each contained in a separate folder named after the software. The folder
name SHALL be written in lower case letters with words separated by single `-`
hypen signs.

Further documentation pertaining to the project itself SHALL go into the
top-level folder `Documentation`. Information specific to one software MUST be
located underneath its own `Documentation` folder but SHOULD otherwise follow
the same structure as the project documentation for consistency reasons.

The structure below each software configuration folder SHOULD be organized in a
way that best fits the requirements of the individual software being configured.
Nevertheless when commonalities, especially structural similarities, between
certain software configurations evolve then these SHOULD be captured and
endorsed for consistency where reasonable. This MAY mean to externalize common
files and folders below the top-level folder `Shared` with OPTIONAL references,
e.g. soft links, from the affected software configuration folders.

Text files and soft links MAY be versioned. Generated files, e.g. binary build
artifacts, MUST NOT be put under version control. All other kinds of files not
explicitly mentioned for OPTIONAL inclusion are REQUIRED to be excluded from
version control.

=== Git Workflow

This project follows a simple _Git_ workflow because it is mainly intended for
personal use. Therefore the administrative overhead SHOULD be kept at a minimum.
As such I picked the _Integration-Manager_ workflow described in the book
<<pro-git, Pro Git>> rather than a more <<git-workflows, sophisticated>> Git
workflow.

Here is an incomplete but quick overview about how the _Integration-Manager_
workflow is practiced in this project — suggestions for improvements always
welcome:

  * This _Git_ repository

    ** OPTIONAL

      *** is cloned by a user who is interested in it.

      *** is forked by a user who wants to contribute to it.

  * The branch `main'

    ** REQUIRED

      *** is the only source of truth.

      *** is the only integration branch.

      *** is the only branch where the latest more or less stable
          sources are to be found.

      *** is consisting of mostly merge commits of signed tags pointing to
          completed topic branches except for a few self-contained but signed
          commits here and there.

      *** is the authoritative history that can be easily followed with
          `git-log --first-parent` to get a summary of completed topics.
          Therefore updates MUST be fetched and *rebased* from upstream but MUST
          NOT be fetched and *merged*, e.g. with `git-pull --rebase=false`.

  * A topic branch

    ** REQUIRED

      *** is where all kinds of development happens. It is used for
          features, bugfixes, reworks, experiments etc.

      *** is branched by the contributor from `main' when he starts
          working on the topic.

      *** is completed by marking it with a signed tag.

      *** is merged via a signed tag by the maintainer into `main' when he is
          convinced that the topic has matured enough to form a solid
          foundation for others to base their work upon.

    ** OPTIONAL

      *** is deleted shortly after its work was aborted or completed.

  * A signed tag

    ** REQUIRED

      *** pointing to a completed topic branch is not made public by pushing it
          to a public repository but by merging it into the main branch of that
          topic branch.

    ** OPTIONAL

      *** pointing to a completed topic branch is deleted shortly after it was
          merged into the main branch of that topic branch.
